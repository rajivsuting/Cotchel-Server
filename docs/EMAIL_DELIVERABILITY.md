## Overview

This guide explains how to improve email deliverability and avoid spam filters for order confirmation emails.

## Recent Improvements Made

### 1. Enhanced Email Headers

- Added proper `from` name: "Cotchel - Electronics Marketplace"
- Added `replyTo` address: "support@cotchel.com"
- Added anti-spam headers:
  - `X-Mailer`: Identifies the email service
  - `X-Priority`: Sets normal priority
  - `X-MSMail-Priority`: Normal priority for Outlook
  - `Importance`: Normal importance level
  - `X-Cotchel-Order`: Custom header for identification

### 2. Improved Subject Lines

**Before:**

- `Order Confirmed - #12345 | Cotchel`
- `Order Shipped - #12345 | Cotchel`

**After:**

- `Your Order #12345 is Confirmed - Cotchel`
- `Your Order #12345 has been Shipped - Cotchel`

### 3. Better Email Structure

- Added proper meta tags for email clients
- Added format detection prevention
- Added unsubscribe links
- Improved footer with proper disclaimers

### 4. SendGrid Configuration

- Added email categories: `['order-confirmation', 'transactional']`
- Added custom arguments for tracking
- Proper sender verification setup

## Environment Variables Required

```env
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key
SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=your_verified_sender_email@yourdomain.com
CLIENT_URL=https://yourdomain.com
```

## SendGrid Setup Requirements

### 1. Verify Your Sender Email

- Go to SendGrid Dashboard → Settings → Sender Authentication
- Verify your domain or single sender email
- The `SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL` must be verified

### 2. Domain Authentication (Recommended)

- Set up domain authentication in SendGrid
- Add SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records to your DNS
- This significantly improves deliverability

### 3. IP Warmup (For High Volume)

- If sending high volumes, use SendGrid's IP warmup process
- Start with low volumes and gradually increase

## Best Practices for Deliverability
